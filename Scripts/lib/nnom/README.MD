fully_connected_opt_weight_generation.py - is from https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/tree/develop/CMSIS/NN/Scripts/NNFunctions witch is not a part of NNoM

Please refer to NNoM documents for its usages.

For the implementation of the primitives, only the file nnom_utils.py has been modified : the generation of the .h file will be done with the "generate_model" function of this file.
