# Experiments on Nucleo-F401RE 

## Folder organization

* Experiment_Filters : folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the number of filters on the latency and consumption of the differents primitives.
* Experiment_Frequency : folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the MCU's frequency on the latency and consumption of the differents primitives.
* Experiment_Groups :  folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the number of groups on the latency and consumption of grouped convolutions.
* Experiment_Inputchannels : folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the number of input channel on the latency and consumption of the differents primitives.
* Experiment_Inputwidth : folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the input width on the latency and consumption of the differents primitives.
* Experiment_Kernelsize : folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the kernel size on the latency and consumption of the differents primitives.
* Experiment_Optimization : folder with the results of the experiment to see the influence of the optimization level on the latency and consumption of the differents primitives.
